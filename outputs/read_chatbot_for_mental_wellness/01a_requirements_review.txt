### Strengths:
*   **Clear Introduction:** The introduction clearly states the purpose, scope, and target users of the chatbot.
*   **Logical Structure:** The document is well-organized into sections covering introduction, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and future considerations.
*   **Defined Scope:** The document explicitly states what the chatbot *won't* do (e.g., provide medical diagnoses), which is crucial for managing user expectations.
*   **Accessibility Focus:** Inclusion of accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1) is a positive step.

### Issues:
*   **Lack of Specificity in NLU:** FR-NLU-002‚Äôs accuracy requirement (85%) is vague. How will this be measured? What constitutes a successful intent recognition?
*   **Insufficient Detail in Conversation Management:** FR-CM-003 states the chatbot will use a knowledge base, but doesn‚Äôt specify the format or structure of this knowledge base.  There‚Äôs no mention of conversational flow design or error handling.
*   **Limited Content Detail:** FR-KB-001 mentions ‚Äúcommon mental wellness topics,‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt specify the breadth or depth of information.  FR-KB-002 lists a minimum of 5 resources, but doesn‚Äôt detail the criteria for selecting them (reputation, relevance, etc.).
*   **Data Privacy Ambiguity:** NFR-SEC-001 mentions compliance with privacy regulations, but doesn‚Äôt specify which ones or how they will be implemented.
*   **Testing Not Addressed:** There‚Äôs no mention of testing strategies or acceptance criteria.
*   **Missing Error Handling:** The document doesn‚Äôt address how the chatbot will handle unexpected user input or system errors.

### Suggestions:
*   **NLU - Define Metrics:**  Specify how intent recognition accuracy will be measured (e.g., using a test dataset with labeled intents). Define what constitutes a "successful" intent recognition ‚Äì what level of confidence is required?
*   **Conversation Management - Detail Flow Design:** Describe the process for designing conversational flows. Will there be state management? How will the chatbot handle ambiguous or unclear user input? Include a section on error handling (e.g., what happens if the chatbot doesn‚Äôt understand the user?).
*   **Content & Knowledge Base - Specify Format & Curation:** Detail the format of the knowledge base (e.g., FAQ, structured data, etc.). Outline the criteria for selecting and maintaining external resources. Consider a content review process.
*   **Data Privacy - Specify Regulations & Implementation:**  Clearly state which privacy regulations apply (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA if applicable) and describe the specific measures that will be taken to ensure compliance (e.g., data encryption, anonymization, user consent).
*   **Add Testing Requirements:** Include sections for unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). Define specific acceptance criteria for each functional requirement.
*   **Expand Non-Functional Requirements:** Add requirements related to scalability, reliability, and maintainability.
*   **Consider a User Journey Map:**  Adding a high-level user journey map would help visualize the user experience and identify potential areas for improvement.
