## Refined Functional Requirements

**1. Chatbot Core Functionality**

*   **FR1.1: Text Input & Processing:** The chatbot shall accept text input from the user via a text-based interface (e.g., chat window). The chatbot shall process the input to identify the user’s intent and relevant keywords.
*   **FR1.2: Intent Recognition:** The chatbot shall accurately identify the user’s intent from their text input, utilizing Natural Language Understanding (NLU) techniques. Supported intents include:
    *   Seeking advice (general or specific)
    *   Expressing feelings (e.g., sadness, anxiety, frustration)
    *   Casual conversation/chit-chat
    *   Requesting resources (e.g., helpline numbers, websites)
    *   Reporting a crisis situation
*   **FR1.3: Response Generation:** The chatbot shall generate appropriate responses based on the identified intent and context. Responses shall be empathetic, supportive, and non-judgmental.
*   **FR1.4: Conversation History:** The chatbot shall maintain a conversation history for each user session, allowing it to recall previous interactions and provide more personalized responses. The history should be limited to a configurable number of previous turns (e.g., 5-10 turns) to manage memory usage.

**2. Topic Coverage & Knowledge Base**

*   **FR2.1: Mental Wellness Topics:** The chatbot shall be knowledgeable about a range of mental wellness topics, including but not limited to: anxiety, depression, stress management, self-care, mindfulness, and coping mechanisms.
*   **FR2.2: Resource Database:** The chatbot shall maintain a database of relevant mental health resources, including:
    *   Crisis hotlines (with direct links and phone numbers)
    *   Mental health websites (with descriptions and links)
    *   Support groups (with contact information)
*   **FR2.3: Content Updates:** The resource database shall be updated regularly (at least quarterly) to ensure accuracy and relevance.

**3. Crisis Detection & Intervention**

*   **FR3.1: Crisis Keyword Detection:** The chatbot shall be able to detect keywords and phrases indicative of a crisis situation (e.g., suicidal thoughts, self-harm, harm to others).
*   **FR3.2: Immediate Support Response:** Upon detecting a potential crisis, the chatbot shall immediately respond with a supportive message and offer immediate help, including:
    *   Providing contact information for crisis hotlines (e.g., Suicide Prevention Lifeline, Crisis Text Line)
    *   Suggesting immediate actions the user can take (e.g., reach out to a trusted friend or family member)
*   **FR3.3: Escalation Protocol:** The chatbot shall have a defined escalation protocol for handling crisis situations, potentially involving notifying a human moderator or providing information to emergency services (with appropriate safeguards and user consent where possible).

**4. User Experience & Interface**

*   **FR4.1: 24/7 Availability:** The chatbot shall be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
*   **FR4.2: User-Friendly Interface:** The chatbot’s interface shall be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and a simple chat window.

*   **FR5.3: Anonymization:** Where possible, user data should be anonymized to protect user privacy.

**6. Learning & Improvement (Future Enhancement)**

*   **FR6.1: Feedback Mechanism:** The chatbot shall provide a mechanism for users to provide feedback on its responses (e.g., thumbs up/down).
*   **FR6.2: Response Analysis:** The chatbot’s responses shall be analyzed periodically to identify areas for improvement.
*   **FR6.3: Model Retraining:** The chatbot’s underlying NLU model shall be retrained periodically using user feedback and conversation data to improve its accuracy and effectiveness.
