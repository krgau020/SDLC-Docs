**Original Client Requirements**

The client wants a chatbot that can help people with their mental wellness. It should be able to read text that users type in, understand what they’re saying, and respond in a helpful way. It needs to be able to offer basic support, like acknowledging feelings and suggesting relaxation techniques. It should also be able to provide links to external resources if needed. The chatbot should be friendly and non-judgmental. It’s important that the chatbot doesn’t give medical advice, but rather offers supportive information and directs users to professional help when necessary. The chatbot should be easy to use and accessible on different devices.  It should also be able to remember previous conversations to provide more personalized support.  Ideally, it would be able to detect if a user is in crisis and immediately offer resources for immediate help.  The chatbot should be available 24/7.  Finally, the client wants to track how often the chatbot is used and what topics users are discussing to improve its effectiveness.

**Refined Functional Requirements**

**1. Chatbot Core Functionality**

1.1. **Text Input & Processing:** The chatbot shall accept text input from the user via a text-based interface (e.g., chat window). The chatbot shall utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the user’s input.
1.2. **Intent Recognition:** The chatbot shall accurately identify the user’s intent from their text input.  This includes, but is not limited to: expressing sadness, anxiety, stress, loneliness, seeking relaxation techniques, requesting information about mental health resources, and indicating a crisis situation.

1.4. **Contextual Awareness:** The chatbot shall maintain context throughout the conversation, referencing previous turns to provide more personalized and coherent responses.  A conversation history of at least 5 turns shall be maintained.
1.5. **Fallback Response:** If the chatbot cannot understand the user’s input or determine the intent, it shall provide a polite and helpful fallback response, such as “I’m sorry, I didn’t quite understand. Could you please rephrase your question?” or “I’m still learning.  Could you tell me more about what you’re experiencing?”

**2. Support & Information Provision**

2.1. **Basic Support:** The chatbot shall offer general support by acknowledging the user’s feelings (e.g., “That sounds difficult,” “I’m here to listen”).
