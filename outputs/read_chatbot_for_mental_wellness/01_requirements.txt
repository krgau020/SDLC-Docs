## **Original Client Requirements**

The client envisions a chatbot designed to support users’ mental wellness. The chatbot should be capable of receiving and processing user-provided text, generating appropriate and helpful responses. The core functionality revolves around understanding diverse user requests, encompassing seeking advice, expressing emotions, casual conversation, and accessing resources. The chatbot should exhibit a friendly and supportive demeanor throughout interactions. Furthermore, it needs to maintain context across multiple conversations to deliver personalized support. The chatbot’s scope includes addressing various mental health topics, such as anxiety, depression, stress, and self-care strategies. Crucially, the system must be able to detect potential crisis situations and provide immediate access to relevant support resources. Availability 24/7 is a key requirement. Usability and ease of understanding are paramount, alongside robust security measures to protect user privacy. Continuous learning and adaptation based on user interactions are desired to enhance response quality over time. The chatbot’s tone should be empathetic and non-judgmental, incorporating suggestions for relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises. Finally, the chatbot must effectively handle ambiguous or unclear user input.
