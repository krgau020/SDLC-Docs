**Original Client Requirements**

The client wants a chatbot that can help people with their mental wellness. It should be able to read text that the user types in, and then respond in a helpful way. It needs to be able to understand different types of requests, like asking for advice, expressing feelings, or just needing someone to talk to. The chatbot should be empathetic and supportive. It should also be able to offer resources like links to mental health organizations or crisis hotlines if needed. The chatbot should be available 24/7. It should be easy to use and understand, even for people who aren't tech-savvy.  It’s important that the chatbot doesn’t give medical advice, but rather provides support and directs users to professional help when necessary.  The chatbot should learn from user interactions to improve its responses over time.  Privacy and security are paramount; user data must be protected.  The chatbot should be able to handle a wide range of emotional states, from sadness and anxiety to anger and frustration.  It should also be able to recognize when a user is in crisis and immediately offer support and resources.  Finally, the chatbot should be customizable to different user preferences, such as tone of voice and level of detail.
