**Original Client Requirements**

The client wants a chatbot that can help people with their mental wellness. It should be able to read text that users type in, understand what they’re saying, and respond in a helpful way. It needs to be able to offer basic support, like acknowledging feelings and suggesting coping mechanisms. It should also be able to provide links to external resources if needed. The chatbot should be friendly and non-judgmental. It’s important that the chatbot doesn’t give medical advice, but rather offers support and directs users to professional help when necessary. The chatbot should be available 24/7.  It should also be able to remember previous conversations to provide more personalized support.  Ideally, it should be easy to use and accessible on different devices.  The client also wants to track how often users are using the chatbot and what topics they are discussing, but they are unsure how to do this without compromising user privacy.  Finally, they want to be able to easily update the chatbot’s responses and knowledge base.
