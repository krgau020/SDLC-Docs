# Project Design Document: Mental Wellness Chatbot – Serene

**1. Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to develop a chatbot – tentatively named “Serene” – that provides accessible and supportive mental wellness resources and techniques to users. Serene will aim to reduce feelings of isolation, offer coping mechanisms for common mental health challenges (anxiety, stress, low mood), and guide users towards professional help when appropriate.  Success will be measured by user engagement, positive feedback regarding helpfulness, and a demonstrable increase in user self-reported well-being (tracked through optional surveys).

**2. Scope**

*   **In-Scope:**
    *   Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for intent recognition and entity extraction related to mental wellness topics.
    *   Dialog management to guide users through conversations and provide tailored responses.
    *   Integration with a knowledge base of evidence-based techniques (e.g., mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, cognitive reframing).
    *   Optional integration with a directory of mental health professionals (with user consent).
    *   Basic sentiment analysis to detect user distress levels.
    *   User authentication and data privacy measures.
    *   A mobile-first design (accessible via web and potentially native mobile apps).
*   **Out-of-Scope:**
    *   Diagnosis of mental health conditions.
    *   Providing therapy or counseling.
    *   Replacing professional mental health treatment.
    *   Complex, personalized treatment plans. (Focus will be on general support and guidance).

**3. Component Breakdown**

*   **User Interface (UI):**  A web-based interface (responsive design) and potentially a mobile app interface.  This will handle user input, display chatbot responses, and manage user accounts.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Engine:**  Responsible for understanding user input. This will include:
    *   **NLU Module:**  Intent recognition (e.g., “I’m feeling anxious,” “How can I relax?”) and entity extraction (e.g., identifying specific emotions, situations).  We will explore using a pre-trained model like BERT and fine-tuning it on a dataset of mental wellness conversations.
    *   **Dialog Manager:**  Controls the flow of the conversation based on user input and the current state of the interaction.  A rule-based system combined with a reinforcement learning approach will be considered for adaptability.
*   **Knowledge Base:**  A repository of information on mental wellness techniques, resources, and relevant articles.  This will be structured for efficient retrieval by the NLP engine.  The knowledge base will be initially populated with content from reputable sources like the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and the Mayo Clinic.
*   **Sentiment Analysis Module:**  Analyzes user text to detect emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral, and potentially specific emotions like anxiety or sadness).  We will utilize a pre-trained sentiment analysis model and potentially fine-tune it for the nuances of mental health conversations.
*   **Database:** Stores user data (anonymized and with appropriate privacy safeguards), conversation history (optional and with user consent), and knowledge base content.  PostgreSQL will be used for its reliability and scalability.
*   **API Integrations:**  (Future Phase) Integration with mental health professional directories and potentially external wellness services.

**4. Architecture Overview**

The system will adopt a microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability.

1.  **User Interface:**  The UI will communicate with the backend via RESTful APIs.
2.  **API Gateway:**  Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.  This will handle authentication and rate limiting.
3.  **NLP Microservice:**  Handles all NLP tasks (NLU, Dialog Management, Sentiment Analysis).  This will likely utilize a cloud-based NLP platform (e.g., Dialogflow, Rasa) or a custom-built solution.  We will prioritize Rasa for its flexibility and open-source nature.
4.  **Knowledge Base Microservice:**  Provides access to the knowledge base content.  This will be optimized for fast retrieval using an indexing strategy.
5.  **Database Microservice:**  Manages user data and conversation history.
6.  **Authentication Microservice:** Handles user registration, login, and authentication.  We will implement OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.

**Diagram (Textual Representation):**

```
[User (Web/Mobile)] <--> [API Gateway]
                      |
                      V
        [NLP Microservice] -- [Knowledge Base Microservice]
                      |
                      V
        [Database Microservice] -- [Authentication Microservice]
```

**5. Technology Stack (Preliminary)**

*   **Frontend:** React, JavaScript
*   **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django)
*   **NLP:** Rasa (with Dialogflow for initial prototyping)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **Cloud Platform:** AWS (EC2, RDS, S3)

**6. Data Privacy and Security**

*   All user data will be anonymized and stored securely.
*   We will comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA – depending on the target audience).
*   Encryption will be used for data in transit and at rest.
*   Regular security audits will be conducted.
