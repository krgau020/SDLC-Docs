## Original Client Requirements

The client wants to create a chatbot that can help people with their mental wellness. It should be able to offer support and guidance, and potentially connect users with resources if needed. The chatbot should be friendly and approachable, and it should be available 24/7. It needs to be easy to use and understand, even for people who aren’t tech-savvy.  It should be able to handle a variety of topics related to mental health, such as stress, anxiety, and depression.  The chatbot should also be able to track a user’s mood and provide personalized recommendations.  Privacy and security are extremely important – user data must be protected.  The chatbot should be integrated with a simple interface, ideally accessible through a web browser and a mobile app.  The client envisions a system that learns from user interactions to improve its responses over time.  Finally, the chatbot should be able to escalate users to human support if they are in crisis.

## Refined Functional Requirements

**1. Overall Goals & Scope**

*   **FR1.1 - Goal:** To provide accessible, 24/7 support and resources for users experiencing mental wellness challenges.
*   **FR1.2 - Scope:** The chatbot will focus on providing information, coping strategies, mood tracking, and connection to external resources. It will *not* provide therapy or diagnosis.
*   **FR1.3 - Availability:** The chatbot will be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, through a web interface and a dedicated mobile application (iOS and Android).

**2. User Interaction & Conversation Flow**

*   **FR2.1 - Greeting & Onboarding:** The chatbot will initiate a friendly greeting and guide new users through a brief onboarding process to understand its capabilities and limitations.
*   **FR2.2 - Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** The chatbot must accurately interpret user input, including variations in phrasing and slang, with an accuracy rate of 85% or higher (measured through a test dataset).
*   **FR2.3 - Intent Recognition:** The chatbot must accurately identify the user's intent (e.g., “I’m feeling anxious,” “I need help with stress,” “What are some relaxation techniques?”).
*   **FR2.4 - Dialogue Management:** The chatbot must maintain a coherent and contextually relevant conversation flow, remembering previous interactions within a session.
*   **FR2.5 - Response Variety:** The chatbot should provide a diverse range of responses, avoiding repetitive phrasing.  A minimum of 3 different response variations should be available for common intents.

**3. Functional Capabilities**

*   **FR3.1 - Mood Tracking:** The chatbot will allow users to log their mood daily using a simple scale (e.g., 1-10, or categories like “Good,” “Okay,” “Bad”).
*   **FR3.2 - Coping Strategy Suggestions:** Based on the user’s reported mood and identified needs, the chatbot will suggest relevant coping strategies (e.g., deep breathing exercises, mindfulness techniques, journaling prompts).  A library of at least 20 coping strategies will be maintained.
*   **FR3.3 - Information Provision:** The chatbot will provide accurate and evidence-based information on common mental health topics, such as anxiety, depression, stress management, and self-care.  Information sources must be reputable (e.g., WHO, APA, NIMH).

*   **FR4.3 - Platform Integration:** The chatbot will be developed using a scalable and maintainable architecture, suitable for integration with web and mobile platforms.
*   **FR4.4 - Learning & Improvement:** The chatbot will incorporate machine learning algorithms to continuously improve its NLU and response accuracy based on user interactions.  A minimum of 5% improvement in NLU accuracy is desired after 6 months of operation.
*   **FR4.5 - Logging & Analytics:** The chatbot will log all user interactions for analysis and improvement purposes, while maintaining user privacy.
