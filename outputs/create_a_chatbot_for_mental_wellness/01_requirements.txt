## Original Client Requirements

The client wants to create a chatbot that can help people with their mental wellness. It should be available 24/7 and provide support for a range of issues, including anxiety, depression, and stress. The chatbot should be empathetic and non-judgmental. It should be able to offer coping mechanisms, relaxation techniques, and resources for further help. The chatbot should be easy to use and accessible to people of all ages and technical abilities. It’s important that the chatbot doesn’t provide medical advice, but rather directs users to professional help when needed. The chatbot should be able to personalize the experience based on user input and track their progress over time.  The client also wants to integrate with existing mental health platforms and potentially offer premium features like guided meditations.  Finally, data privacy and security are paramount.
