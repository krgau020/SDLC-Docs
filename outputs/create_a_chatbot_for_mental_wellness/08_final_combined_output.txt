# Mental Wellness Chatbot – Serene: Technical Documentation

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the technical specifications for “Serene,” a chatbot designed to provide accessible and supportive mental wellness resources and techniques to users. Serene aims to reduce feelings of isolation, offer coping mechanisms for common mental health challenges, and guide users towards professional help when needed. This document combines the user needs outlined in the User Story, the detailed design specifications from the Project Design Document (PDD), and the architectural blueprint from the System Design Document (SDD) to provide a complete overview of the project.

**2. User Story Summary**

The core functionality of Serene is driven by the following user stories:

*   **As a User, I want to be able to initiate a conversation with the chatbot, so that I can start exploring my feelings and experiences.** (Focus: Welcoming initial interaction and clear instructions)
*   **As a User, I want to be able to express my feelings and thoughts in a free-text format, so that I can process my emotions.** (Focus: Accepting user input without judgment and displaying it clearly)
*   **As a User, I want the chatbot to offer a range of guided exercises (e.g., breathing exercises, mindfulness prompts), so that I can learn coping mechanisms.** (Focus: Providing structured support and techniques)
*   **As a User, I want the chatbot to provide information about common mental health conditions (e.g., anxiety, depression), so that I can better understand my experiences.** (Focus: Delivering factual, sourced information)
*   **As a User, I want to be able to set a mood or intention for the conversation, so that the chatbot can tailor its responses.** (Focus: Personalization and relevance)
*   **As a User, I want the chatbot to offer resources for professional help (e.g., helpline numbers, websites), so that I can seek support if needed.** (Focus: Providing access to external support)
*   **As a User, I want to be able to end the conversation, so that I can leave when I’m finished.** (Focus: Graceful termination of interaction)
