**Original Client Requirements**

The client wants to create a chatbot that can help people with their mental wellness. It should be able to offer support, provide resources, and potentially guide users through basic exercises. The chatbot should be friendly and approachable, and it needs to be available 24/7. It should be able to handle a variety of topics related to mental health, such as stress, anxiety, and depression. The chatbot should also be able to recognize when a user is in crisis and offer appropriate support or direct them to professional help.  It’s important that the chatbot doesn’t provide diagnoses or therapy, but rather acts as a supportive companion and information source.  The chatbot should be easy to use and accessible on multiple platforms (web, mobile app).  Personalization is desired – the chatbot should remember user preferences and tailor its responses accordingly.  Data privacy and security are paramount.  The chatbot should be continuously learning and improving based on user interactions.  Integration with existing mental health resources (e.g., crisis hotlines, therapy directories) is a plus.  The client envisions a phased rollout, starting with a limited set of features and expanding over time.  The chatbot’s tone should be empathetic and non-judgmental.
