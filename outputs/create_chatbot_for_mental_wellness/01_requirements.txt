## **Original Client Requirements**

The client wants to create a chatbot that can help people with their mental wellness. It should be able to offer support and guidance, and potentially connect users with resources if needed. The chatbot should be friendly and approachable, and it should be available 24/7. Users should be able to talk to the chatbot about a variety of topics, such as stress, anxiety, and depression. The chatbot should also be able to provide users with relaxation techniques, such as meditation and deep breathing exercises.  It’s important that the chatbot doesn’t offer medical advice, but rather provides supportive information and directs users to professional help when necessary.  The chatbot should be easy to use and accessible on multiple platforms (web, mobile app).  We want to ensure user privacy and data security.  The chatbot should be able to personalize the experience based on user input and preferences.  Finally, we need analytics to track usage and identify areas for improvement.
