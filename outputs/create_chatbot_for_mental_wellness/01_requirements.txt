**Original Client Requirements**

The client wants to create a chatbot that can help people with their mental wellness. It should be able to answer basic questions about mental health, offer coping mechanisms, and provide a safe space for users to talk about their feelings. The chatbot should be available 24/7 and easy to use. It needs to be empathetic and non-judgmental.  It should also be able to recognize when a user is in crisis and offer resources for immediate help.  Ideally, it would learn from user interactions to provide more personalized support over time.  There should be options for users to set goals and track their progress.  Integration with existing mental health platforms would be a plus.  The chatbot should be HIPAA compliant to ensure user privacy and data security.  Finally, the client wants to measure the chatbot’s effectiveness through user satisfaction surveys and tracking key metrics like session duration and frequency of use.
