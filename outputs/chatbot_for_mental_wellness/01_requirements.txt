**Original Client Requirements**

The client wants a chatbot that can help people with their mental wellness. It should be able to answer basic questions about mental health, offer coping mechanisms, and provide a safe space for users to express their feelings. The chatbot should be available 24/7 and easy to use. It needs to be empathetic and non-judgmental.  It should also be able to recognize when a user is in crisis and offer resources for immediate help.  Ideally, it would track user progress and offer personalized recommendations.  The chatbot should integrate with existing mental health resources and platforms.  It should be HIPAA compliant and prioritize user privacy.  The client envisions a conversational interface, possibly with some visual elements like calming images.  There’s a desire for it to be engaging and not feel like a clinical interview.  It needs to be adaptable to different user needs and backgrounds.  Finally, the client wants to measure the chatbot’s effectiveness through user feedback and usage data.
