The chatbot should be available 24/7 and easy to use. It needs to be empathetic and non-judgmental.  It should also be able to recognize when a user is in crisis and offer resources for immediate help.  Ideally, it would track user progress and offer personalized recommendations.  The chatbot should integrate with existing mental health resources and platforms.  It needs to be HIPAA compliant.  The client also wants it to be engaging and fun to use, not just a dry information source.  There should be options for different personalities and tones.  Finally, the client wants analytics to track usage and identify areas for improvement.
