**Original Client Requirements**

The client wants a chatbot that helps people feel better mentally. It should be friendly and supportive. It needs to be able to recognize when someone is struggling and offer helpful resources. It should be available 24/7. Users should be able to talk about whatever they’re feeling, and the chatbot should respond in a way that makes them feel heard and understood. It should also be able to guide users through simple relaxation exercises and mindfulness techniques.  It’s important that the chatbot doesn’t give medical advice, but rather directs users to professional help when needed.  The chatbot should be easy to use and accessible on both web and mobile platforms.  It should also be able to personalize the experience based on the user’s needs and preferences.  Finally, the client wants to track user engagement and identify areas for improvement.  There should be a way to collect feedback from users about their experience with the chatbot.
